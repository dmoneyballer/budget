# budget
in order to get the Flask app running you should run the command: . venv/bin/activate
after you have done this, you can pip install a dependency: pip install flask_cors
once this is done you are free to run flask run and it'll run on localhost port 5000
the index.html works to display your budget app.
the state.json file has the budget amounts as columns and the budget categories are rows so you can modify those to whatever you normally have.
these display in the table in the html and the model gets updated every time you add an expense or expense category.
